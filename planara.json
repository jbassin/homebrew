As part of any successful melee attack, as an action, or as a reaction to a successful melee attack against you, you may transfer this magic into the body of another creature.

The first time the magic is transferred there is a 10% chance of this occurring. This chance increases by 10% each time it transfers. If you hold the magic for one full round, you must increase the chance by 30% and roll as if it was transferred to you.",
